Kingkade,"First off I just wanted to add this and it‚Äôs important. AMAZON... Please stop using JoeyCo Inc to deliver your products. Both times I‚Äôve had orders with this company they‚Äôve delivered the product nowhere near to my door, setting me up for possible theft. Their customer service is impossible to connect with too. Super shady company. If you do Google reviews for JoeyCo Inc, they‚Äôre all bad, often people experiencing the same thing, poor delivery.Lastly, this product is incredible and I‚Äôm able to side load other apps on it as well, what kind of apps? Well, the good ones, I‚Äôll just leave it at that. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the main page has advertisements on it, so technically it‚Äôs irritating spam which isn‚Äôt welcomed. Other then that, Alexa voice control works great, and the quality makes you feel like you get your money‚Äôs worth. Sometimes too, the remote looses connectivity, it‚Äôs really only ever happened once, fingers crossed it doesn‚Äôt happen again.It‚Äôs close to a perfect device, but the crap delivery service and the ad‚Äôs built in to the device is stopping me from giving this a perfect score. For the money though, you can‚Äôt go wrong.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 16, 2021"

Ashley,"So far, this has been a huge disappointment. Volume does not work, the Firestick keeps turning off randomly without being able to stream anything, delivery was late and replacement is being offered for delivery in 2 weeks.Not so great on this one Amazon, not so great.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 15, 2021"
Mouse,"This device works well enough, but keep remote handy as simple commands continually fail. I have an flex plugged directly behind my chair linked and it will find shows well enough, but simple commands to pause,play or mute fail 8 out of 10 times. Alexa responds with I don't know that. All commands are on the list of it's supposed capabilities. Hands free?? Not at all. I still have to use the remote 80 percent of the time because Alexa fails to do what was asked.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 17, 2021"
Patrick,"This product works as advertised.  I have it running on my 5G WiFi and the streaming and picture quality are fantastic.  Navigation and selection of services and options is easy to use and understand.  The one issue I had was with the very basic instructions that came with it.  It shows to plug the stick into the TV, however in doing that I had no sound.  There is nothing in the FAQ to suggest an alternative.  I did find a video that clearly shows how to connect the Fire TV Stick directly to your AV Receiver as an input device, using the extender connection into a HDMI input.  Works!  Now I just need to get the sound quality balanced as dialogue is weak.  Also, my Sony Sound Surround system is not on the list of compatible devices, however the remote will turn it on/off along with my older LG TV.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2021"

Angelz,Absolutely better then paying for satellite TV or cable ! I get all my shows and kids get every cartoon or show they love... since I pay for internet anyway this is the way To Go! Buying more for kids rooms too! Worth the money! Easy set up.  Literally plug and watch TV. Love that I can ask Alexa to find my show and it give me options on which app to watch it on. Hands down 100% Worth it .,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 24, 2021"
Greg D,"The product itself is easy to use, just takes time to set up.  Very limited on streaming options, just your basics that you can get on almost all other devices so don‚Äôt waste your money if you have one that works already.Very limited storage which I turn limits your already limited apps.I‚Äôve had mine a few months and out of nowhere a small black rectangle appeared in the upper left corner.  Amazon was quick to offer a new device (which I‚Äôm still waiting for) but upon further investigation I quickly discovered this issue seems to have been going on for years and there are only work arounds to try getting the rectangle to disappear which done always work or they don‚Äôt work for long.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2021"
Crazy Canuck,I‚Äôm used to using an Apple TV unit but decided to give the new Gen Firestick a try hoping to save some money. Well what I saved in money is nice but the frustration using the Firestick compared to the Apple TV wasn‚Äôt worth it. This thing is all over the place. Menus don‚Äôt make any sense and it takes a lot of clicking to get where you want to be. Just don‚Äôt find it as intuitive as the Apple product. No user manual available from Amazon other than a QuickStart guide. Wish I had spent the extra on the Apple unit.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 5, 2021"
Gwen,"This was easy to install and set up. My old system was a Roku, and while that is a nice one as well for someone that wants basic; I upgraded to the Firestick for the fact that it can be synced to my echo dot, has voice activated use. I love that my echo is synced so when I want to change apps I can just talk out loud to the echo and it will change while I'm doing something in the other room. I will be buying another one of the Firestick for my living room TV. easier to install, set up and get your apps set up! Reccomend for anyone that wants something to stream more than one app; check what is available.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 15, 2021"
Amazon Customer,DOES NOT WORK WITH BELL TV app UNLESS YOU HAVE BELL Internet.  Which makes it useless for me ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  We bought it to use the bell tv app to watch the sports channels we already pay for through bell.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2021"
Reese,"Great for casual customers, easy to plug in and setup, streaming services work as intended, remote works just fine, only thing is a home theatre setup will just crash your firestick when ever video is played, so if you‚Äôre looking at using this as a mini home theatre with echos and an Alexa DON‚ÄôT, music works fine, videos not so much, very disappointed Amazon has yet to replace their team with people who actually know how to make electronics, if only some cool tech YouTuber like Austin Evans could find a way to water cool a firestick this device would work so much better and be worth twice as much, other than that MAJOR issue, this product is alright just for casual viewing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 12, 2021"

Kindle Customer,"Fantastic.  Works great, tv controls are fantastic. Took a few trys to figure out how to switch from our gaming system back to the firstick with just the firestick remote but once you get it everything is great.  I haven't used my tv's remote since I got my firestick.Short cut  buttons for prime, Netflix, & Disney are great.  Was easy to install various apps for different free tv options.  Wish some of actual tv channels would be available for free, but that is no fault of Amazon or the firestick.I highly recommend this firestick model!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 4, 2021"
RALLO,"Had to manually link the FireStick to one of my Amazon Echos and can only be paired with one at a time for some reason? When using Alexa on the FireStick remote I still can‚Äôt control my lights or any other smart home devices. My Sony TV is set to sleep after 15 mins of inactivity. This works well on its native apps, my PS3 and my PS5. The FireStick stays on indefinitely and does not allow my TV to turn off... meaning it‚Äôll stay on all night if I fall asleep. The overall experience has been better than my TV‚Äôs Android OS and I can finally actually use voice control (TV‚Äôs built in Google Assistant is terrible) but these issues hold it back from being a nearly flawless experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 29, 2021"
Olivia White,I had been putting off getting a fire stick for a while and I was missing out. Glad I finally made this purchase.Get the option where you can control volume and power buttons... it‚Äôs $10 more but well worth it.The fire stick is better than the ‚Äúroku‚Äù for any of you trying to decide between the two.Fire stick offers more apps.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 23, 2021"

Random black screen, but the audio is coming through, so at least I can listen to the show I'm unable to watch.Great for the price, when it works.Initial power cord is a bit short, take into account how far away your outlet is, you may need a longer cable.

Juliet,there are better options out there. it runs good but every time i turn on my tv it will ALWAYS say ‚Äúno signal‚Äù so i would have to physically unplug and plug it back in again for it to work. every time man. every time i go to turn it on it always says no signal and i‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING customer service says and what other people on the internet says and it still won‚Äôt work. it‚Äôs so annoying and it beats the purpose of having this device do a lot for you. waste of money.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 3, 2021"

You can connect to all of you accounts (prime, Netflix, etc) and see many movies, tv shows, ect.
